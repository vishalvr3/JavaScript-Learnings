// Coding Challenge #2

/*
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message can be either "Manish's BMI is higher than Vishal's!" or "Vishal's BMI is higher than Manish's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Manish's BMI (28.3) is higher than Vishal's (23.9)!"

HINT: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
