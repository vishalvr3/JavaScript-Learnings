Javascript is a High-Level , Object-Oriented, Multi-Paradigm Programming Language

# BREAKING DOWN
=> Programming-Language:
                       A Programming-Language is Just a tool that allows us to write code that will instruct a computer to do something.

=> High-Level: 
             We donâ€™t have to think much about a lot of complex stuff such as managing the computers memory while it runs our programme.

=> Object-Oriented: language is mostly based on the concept of objects for storing most kinds of data.

=> Multi-Paradigm: It just means that it's so flexible and versatile, that we can use all kinds of different programming styles, such as imperative and declarative programming. These different styles are just
different ways of structuring our code.
