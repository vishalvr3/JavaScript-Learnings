/*
Manish and Vishal are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).

1. Store Manish's and Vishal's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs us+ing the formula (you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a boolean variable 'manishHigherBMI' containing information about whether Manish has a higher BMI than Vishal.

TEST DATA 1: Manishs weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. Vishal weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
TEST DATA 2: Manishs weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. Vishal weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
